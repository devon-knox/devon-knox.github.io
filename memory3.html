        I remember this morning was a weird one... I thought I got an A- but then I didn't lol... but it's ok! You made us have such a good day! After you blessed me up with getting my passport (it's giving mommy), we had a BLAST at Drive Shack, then quickly drove back to your house for a lit 2 person pre at your apartment before going to the game. We were lowkey feeling it BUT I do remember you putting this strawberry lip balm thing on me LOL... then, we got turnt after my regrade request was approved! We went to that upper deck and talked about our future for HOURS, and all of a sudden the game was over haha. But it's ok, because you finnessed and got the game ball! We then got some amazing ice cream from Jeni's (bro we had SO much ice cream this summer, it was awesome!) to end a wonderful, eventful day!!!
