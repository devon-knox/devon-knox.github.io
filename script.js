Ella agrees to get on a Bird üõ¥ with Devon to save time, which she immediately regrets - fast turns, risky maneuvers and sexy drifts (I wish!). Anyways, the fucking scooter turns off when we enter the campus grounds, so we try to ride it slowly downhill and then just book it, sprinting in our fancy clothes to my dorm room. I‚Äôm a bit behind her after parking the scooter, and suddenly this guy and girl in a jeep see me and say, ‚Äúneed a lift?‚Äù so with no questions asked, I shout ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù and hop in the back. As Ella‚Äôs up the street, I shout at her from the jeep and we take a much-needed lift to the dorm room. We‚Äôll just say it was an‚Ä¶ interesting pregame (cough cough Ilana üòÇ‚Ä¶ Ben was NOT having it). We take a bus there, and see our friends so we skip the entire line that wrapped around the block. By some coincidence, Ella met ABIGAIL (sorry John!) and they had some great convos apparently üëçüèª. After dancing the night away, I depart for a few hours to run a pledge event (GNOME NIGHT üòàüòàüòà). I scooter to Ella‚Äôs thru the sus 2 AM Durham streets, and thankfully she‚Äôs up! In her bed, she brings up why me and Harrison kept whispering and looking at her‚Ä¶ little did she know that I was telling him I was gonna say those three words tonight! So we‚Äôre laying on our sides facing each other, and I look at her and say it! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞.
