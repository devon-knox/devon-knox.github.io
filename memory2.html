        One of the many things I love about you is how much you love being out in nature. Making those tasty cold cut sandwiches and then rushing over to paddle boarding was so fun! I remember that look in your eyes when we were paddling along the water - pure bliss. It was so fun jumping off the rock and tackling each other off the boards AND drinking the dirty water haha. And then we got that delishhhh Maple View ice cream. It was so fresh! And that view was something else. I remember I had a test I barely studied for on Monday, but I didn't care - that day with you was more than worth it!
